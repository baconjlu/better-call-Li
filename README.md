# About the project
briefly speaking, the project is about developing an app that can go buzzing or vibrating or whatever as long as it can remind user that there are something worthy to pay a visit around. It can be a reputable restaurant or bar or some scenery spots etc. And our group members has already taken the programming task and testing task. the requirement analysis task and system design remain untaken.

# Recruiting Part
![wewantyou](pics/wewantyou.jpg)
to fully take advantage of the fact that we got two gold medal programmer, we set two programmer roles in our group.
and the PM, which means me, will probably take the task of Liaison and communicate directly to every member in our group.
and we are recruiting for two partners from UTAD as Requirement Analyst and System Architect, hopefully so. but everything is negotiable. 

speaking of negotiable, gonna need an example here.such as if everyone wanna be Liaison, then I will take the remaining task.


Together we gonna make a great team, look at the innocent and sincere eyes of this cat(yep,that's a cat)ï¼Œand you know i ain't saying any bullshit and how can a man say no to a recrutement with a lovely cat image.

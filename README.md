# Recruiting Part
![wewantyou](pics/wewantyou.jpg)
to fully take advantage of the fact that we got two gold medal programmer, we set two programmer roles in our group.
and the PM, which means me, will probably take the task of Liaison and communicate directly to every member in our group.
and we are recruiting for Requirement Analyst and System Architect, hopefully so. but everything is negotiable.
speaking of negotiable, gonna need an example here.such as if everyone wanna be Liaison, then I will take the remaining task.


please feel free to contact with me through wechat:mike_zheng02
or you can just add my wechat in the DSD groupchat.
